As long as the sea is bound to Wash up on the sand How long will I want you? As long as you want me to And longer by far How long will I hold you? As long as your father told you As long as you can How long will I give to you? As long as I live through you However long you say How long will I love you? As long as stars are above you And longer if I may How long will I love you? ",
